        In one of my latest e-mails, I shared that some of the greatest stories I’d ever experienced were in video games. 
        I was mostly referring to “old” video games.
        Video games, like cinema, are suffering. Great experiences are rare and seem to be relics of the past. Generic titles follow one another. 
        “Good” games are scarce. A lot of titles focus on technique, forgetting the most important part: a good story.
        And it’s just as hard for video game studios to create great stories. 
        When they try, they are sometimes accused of making “interactive movies”. 
        It takes a skillful blend of gameplay, storytelling, scenario and immersion to create an unforgettable experience.
